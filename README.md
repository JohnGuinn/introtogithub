# Notes on GitHub

## Stage 1: Getting to know the GitHub website

Things to do once you've set up an account on GitHub:

* Create a repository (a 'repo') and tick the box that automatically creates a README.md file
* Open that README.md file on GitHub, and then click the edit button
* Read about Markdown and edit your README.md file (the .md means markdown) to practise basic Markdown
* Create a new file in your repository, with a .md extension

## Stage 2: Getting to know the GitHub desktop client

Install the GitHub 'client' on your computer

* Clone a repo from GitHub to your local client
* Open that repo's files locally, on your computer
* Edit those files
* 'Commit' your changes with a comment (this just means GitHub notes the changes)
* 'Sync' your local changes (this means they are uploaded to the GitHub repo online)
