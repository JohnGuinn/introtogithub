# Forking in GitHub

Forking is very similar to cloning. The key differences are that cloning simply makes a copy; forking not only makes a copy, but creates a connection between your (forked) version of the project, and the original. You can, for example, choose to update your project with any new additions to the original; or submit your changes to be considered for inclusion in the original project (a pull request).

You can fork someone else's repo, and then submit a pull request to have it reintegrated into the main version.

## Getting started with forking

At the top of this repo is a button to '**Fork**' it. Click that button.

A copy of this repo will be created within your own GitHub account. Underneath the name you should see a link back to the original.

I've [created a file which you can edit here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/introtogithub/blob/master/editme.md). 

Edit that file, add some more text, and then commit those changes (and sync if you're using the GitHub client rather than the website)

## Create a pull request

On your repo webapge, go to the pull requests tab and click **New pull request**. You will be shown the differences, (and hopefully "This branch has no conflicts with the base branch"). 

Click **Merge pull request**, and **Confirm**

The creator of the original repo now has to confirm your pull request for it to be reincorporated to the original version.

## Rebasing (updating your version so it reflects changes to the original)

If you’ve forked a repo and want to make sure it’s up to date (i.e. any changes made since you forked are reflected in your version), then follow the instructions here: https://github.com/blog/2243-rebase-and-merge-pull-requests 

Once again you create a pull request, but this time you are pulling changes from the original into your fork.
