# Forking in GitHub

Forking is very similar to cloning. The key differences are that cloning simply makes a copy; forking not only makes a copy, but creates a connection between your (forked) version of the project, and the original. You can, for example, choose to update your project with any new additions to the original; or submit your changes to be considered for inclusion in the original project (a pull request).

You can fork someone else's repo, and then submit a pull request to have it reintegrated into the main version.

## Getting started with forking

At the top of this repo is a button to '**Fork**' it. Click that button.

A copy of this repo will be created within your own GitHub account. Underneath the name you should see a link back to the original.
