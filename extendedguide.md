# More about how GitHub is used within journalism

The [BBC England Data Unit GitHub account](https://github.com/bbc-data-unit) is used for a range of reasons:

* To improve transparency around our work. We share the data behind our stories (unless there are legal reasons not to) and explain the methodology.
* To make it easier for others to help with our reporting. Designers sometimes use our data to create interesting insights and infographics that we could not have produced otherwise.
* To make it easier to collaborate internally. GitHub repos mean we can more quickly direct colleagues to projects, and they can contribute to those remotely.
* To make it easier to track what we have done. The account acts as a record of the stories we have covered, and how. We can then use this to explain to others, or to evaluate.

GitHub is a platform for sharing and collaborating on projects. It is used widely within data journalism by organisations including the Guardian, FT, New York Times, WNYC, ProPublica, and WSJ (see the â€˜More about GitHub section at the end)
