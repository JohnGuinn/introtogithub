# More about how GitHub is used within journalism

GitHub is something of a social network for code: you can use it to follow individual people, or projects. More specifically, GitHub is a platform for sharing and collaborating on projects. You can create groups on the site (by setting up an ‘organisation’ account), and/or use it to 'fork' code by others and adapt/improve it.

It was initially used within web development but is increasingly used by media organisations, in particular data units. Examples include:

* Derek Willis: github.com/dwillis
* Jacqui Maher (Conde Nast): github.com/jacqui
* FT Interactive News: github.com/ft-interactive
* The Guardian: github.com/guardian
* Wall Street Journal graphics team: github.com/WSJ
* ProPublica: github.com/propublica
* NY Public Radio: github.com/nypublicradio
* BBC News Labs: github.com/BBC-News-Labs
* FiveThirtyEight: github.com/fivethirtyeight
* The Upshot: github.com/TheUpshot
* WNYC Data News Team: github.com/datanews
* Quartz’s chart creation tool Chartbuilder (github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder), 
* Vox Media’s site generator Autotune (github.com/voxmedia/autotune) 
* New York Public Radio’s Audiogram, a tool for for generating shareable videos from audio clips (github.com/nypublicradio/audiogram)

The [BBC England Data Unit GitHub account](https://github.com/bbc-data-unit) is used for a range of reasons:

* To improve transparency around our work. We share the data behind our stories (unless there are legal reasons not to) and explain the methodology.
* To make it easier for others to help with our reporting. Designers sometimes use our data to create interesting insights and infographics that we could not have produced otherwise.
* To make it easier to collaborate internally. GitHub repos mean we can more quickly direct colleagues to projects, and they can contribute to those remotely.
* To make it easier to track what we have done. The account acts as a record of the stories we have covered, and how. We can then use this to explain to others, or to evaluate.

Once you have set up an account, try visiting one of the examples listed above. Each GitHub organisation account page will have sections for ‘Repositories’ (projects) and for ‘People’. The People tab allows you to see each person who is a member of that organisation, click through to their page, see what they’re contributing to, and ‘follow’ them. Following someone means you will be alerted when they make a new contribution to the project (this could be adding new code, or new files).

You can also follow individual projects by switching back to the ‘Repositories’ tab, going to a repository page, and looking for the ‘Watch’ button towards the top of the screen. Clicking this allows you to opt in to notifications when the repository is updated.

## Jargon

There is some jargon to get used to on the site. For example:

‘**Repositories**’ (or ‘**repos**’ for short) are collections of code and files. If it was on your computer, you’d simply call it a ‘folder’.

**Cloning** on GitHub means creating a copy of a project on your computer, normally to experiment with it yourself or to try to understand someone’s code.

**Forking** is very similar: this also creates a copy of someone’s project. But this copy will be on GitHub too. When you fork a project, it’s often because you want to maintain a link with the original. For example, you can fetch any updates to the original project in order to keep your version up to date. And it’s much easier to submit a pull request (see below)

**Branching** is a way of creating a copy of your own project, in order to try some different ideas. If your ideas don’t work, you’ve still got the original version and can delete the branch. But if it works well, and you want to reintegrate it into the original, you can submit a pull request (see below) to do so. Branches also allow different people to work on different parts of a project, for example adding new pages.

A **pull request** is a request for your changes to a project to be included in the original version. For example, you might add a line of code, or correct some errors in the text, and want that new line, or that correction, to be reflected in the main project. If your pull request is accepted, then that is what will happen.

**Version control** is a broad term for a system used to track different versions of files within a project. One of the reasons GitHub is so useful is it makes it easier to compare differences between different versions of the same file, and to revert to previous versions if you make mistakes.

## Using GitHub to publish webpages

GitHub also includes a way of easily publishing webpages from your files, called GitHub Pages (pages.github.com). This can be particularly useful if you need to test some code out but don’t want to buy web hosting yet, and it can also be used to showcase your GitHub account in a more polished way. SRF Data, the data-driven journalism unit of Swiss Radio and TV, has a GitHub Pages site at srfdata.github.io, for example, while Guardian Digital Development can be found at guardian.github.io/developers.
